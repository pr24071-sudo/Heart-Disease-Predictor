# Heart-Disease-Predictor


Heart disease predictor is an platform designed and developed to explore the path of artificial intelligence. 
The goal is to predict the health of the  patient from collective data, so as to be able to detect configurations at risk for the patient, and therefore, in cases requiring emergency medical assistance, alert the appropriate medical staff of the situation of the latter.
We initially have a dataset of information of many patients with which we are able to conclude the results into a complete form and can predict data precisely.
 The results of the predictions, derived from the predictive models generated by artificial intelligence,will be presented through distinct graphical interfaces according to the datasets considered.
We will then bring criticism as to the scope of our results.
